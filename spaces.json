      "21st Century, the relationship between art and technology has grown deeper and more nuanced than ever before. We use technology to create art. We view and share art using new and impressive digital tools. And often, technology itself — from products to Web pages — is art.",
      "Join the Digital Arts and Culture Space for workshops, demos, and discussions that unpack the relationship between art, technology, and the Web. We’ll explore how vlogging is becoming an art form of its own; discover how digital tech is making the arts accessible to people with all abilities; ask when code is at its most creative; and understand the role of digital arts in society. Whether you’re a professional artist or a DIY maker, everyone will have an opportunity to create and be inspired."

Software like Django, D3, and Backbone has emerged from newsrooms to power some of the most innovative work on the open Web. And reporting entertains and challenges millions of readers online every day, giving them the information they need to engage with their communities.",
      "In the Journalism Space, we explore how journalism can change our lives, both in person and online. Participants will learn how developers, designers, and data analysts collaborate to cover the most important stories of the day, and how they can contribute to the kind of work that protects the open Web and drives it forward."

We also collaborate on each other’s projects, and our Open Research Accelerator provides one-on-one mentorship for making your project open source. The Open Science Space is open to everyone: We invite hobbyists, researchers, librarians, data scientists, developers, and all others to join us."

In the Open Badges Space, we’ll showcase exciting badges projects, hack on and build badge infrastructure, and encourage new partners and networks adopt badges. We’re also plugging Open Badges into other spaces and sessions across MozFest."

Right now, we have a unique opportunity in the European Union to update and reform copyright laws to enhance -- not hinder -- creativity and innovation. Fuel The Movement will help participants explore how these and other laws impact them -- and what YOU can do about it -- through interactive art installations, hands-on workshops, and lightning talks. Participants will walk away energized to support creativity on the open internet."

Our space is a sandbox for kids, teens, and adults alike to tinker, hack, build, and play as a means of learning. Sessions will be hands-on and centered around Raspberry Pi and virtual reality, with a focus on the artistry of these tools. We’ll also reimagine what a 21st-century library should look like — a collection of open source tools and activities."
