# MozFest 2016 Event App #

This project was derived from the [SRCCON app](https://github.com/OpenNews/srccon-schedule). Hardcoded and event specific bits have been removed from the codebase. We have also made a few things [configuarable](https://github.com/mozilla/schedule-app-core#configs)!

## Configs ##

See [Configs Doc](https://github.com/mozilla/schedule-app-core/blob/gh-pages/docs/CONFIGS.md).

## JSON Format ##

See [JSON Format](https://github.com/mozilla/schedule-app-core/blob/gh-pages/docs/JSON_FORMAT.md).

## SCSS, CSS, and Stylings ##

### Build and Develop ###

**Please do NOT modify `css/style.css` directly.** This file should be autogenerated by running the following commands. :wink:

1. Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to watch changes in `.scss` files in the `/scss` directory. This also compiles `.scss` files into the `style.css` `index.html` links to.
