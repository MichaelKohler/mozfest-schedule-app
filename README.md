# MozFest 2016 Event App #

 ‚ùó**Repo under heavy construction. Currently filled with dummy data.**

This project was derived from the [SRCCON app](https://github.com/OpenNews/srccon-schedule). Hardcoded and event specific bits have been removed from the codebase. We have also made a few things [configuarable](https://github.com/mozilla/schedule-app-core#configs)!

## Configs ##
